# This is not a regular website for broadcasting information. Instead, it is a
# web service hidden behind the HTTP protocol and only intended for users of the
# Software and Systems Security course for assignment-related tasks.
#
# The file you are currently viewing is a Bash-based client to interact with
# the web service. This script is designed for a UNIX-like system (e.g., Ubuntu,
# MacOS, or WSL on Windows) with `bash`, `curl`, and `ssh-keygen` available.
#
# To use this file,
# - save it as a script (e.g., `portal.sh`)
# - change its permission if needed (e.g., `chmod +x portal.sh`) and
# - check its help message `./portal.sh help`

This is a Bash-based Client to the Assignment Portal of CS 489/698

Before using this script, please check that you have set the course variables
correctly on top of this file, including:
- USR_DEFAULT, your UWaterloo username (currently set to "${USR_DEFAULT}")
- KEY_DEFAULT, a path prefix for your key files (currently set to "${KEY_DEFAULT}")

Alternatively, you can supply the same information via environment variables
before calling this script, e.g.,
U=<username> K=<path-prefix-to-passkey> ./portal.sh <command>

Your current username is "${USR}" and path-prefix to passkey is "${KEY}".

The following commands are available for everyone for VM management
- help: print this help message
- register: create a ed25519 key pair and register the user with the public key
- status: check the status of the virtual machine allocated to the user
- launch: launch the virtual machine allocated to the user
- destroy: destroy the virtual machine allocated to the user
- ssh: SSH into the virtual machine allocated to the user

The following commands are available for everyone for building the passkey server
- peek <uid>: examine up to 64 registration and login records from <uid>'s server
- attack <uid>: launch the MiTM attack using your own script against <uid>'s server
- proxy_register <test[1-5]>: register a new user <testN> on your own passkey server
- proxy_login <test[1-5]>: login as a new user <testN> on your own passkey server

The following command are available if you are a system administrator
- reset <uid>: reset the user to a state before registration
- snapshot: take a snapshot of all VMs in the system
- populate: reload the snapshot of all VMs in the system
- shutdown: send a shutdown request to the system
